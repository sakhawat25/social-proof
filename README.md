### What I learned

In this challange, I was able to learn some key features about front-end development like responsive layout. I also used Sass which is a preprocessor for CSS, I came to know the power of Sass by using features like mixins, functions, variables, partials and maps. This challange was also a good reminder about CSS Flexbox.
